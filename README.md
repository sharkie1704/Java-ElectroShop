Java ElectroShop

A Java console-based application that simulates an online shop for electronics. The user is asked to enter their name and address, and then can choose from a main menu of options:
- Set up a budget
- Shop/add items
- Remove items
- Go to cart
- Log out

The user can then browse items (TVs, phones, laptops, or headphones), filter them by price, set up a budget and shop according to it, add items to a shopping cart, and then proceed to checkout. The checkout offers the option of home delivery or in-store pickup.
