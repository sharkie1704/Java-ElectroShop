Java ElectroShop

A Java console-based application that simulates an online shop for electronics. The application can be accessed by an admin via a special password to access certain exclusive functionalities, or by a regular user/client. The user is asked to enter their name and address, and then can choose among a main menu of options:
- Shop for products
- Set up a budget
- Go to cart
- Log out

The user can then browse items (TVs, phones, laptops, or headphones), filter them by price, set up a budget and shop according to it, add items to a shopping cart, and then proceed to checkout. The checkout offers the option of home delivery or in-store pickup.

As for the choices presented to the admin, we have:
- Add a product to the shop
- Remove a product from the shop
- Log out
